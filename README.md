# _Neo Cactus_ for Jekyll
![screenshot](screenshot/home.png)

This Jekyll theme started as a port of [Cactus](https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus) to my own needs, but I ended up performing a lot more modifications than expected. Some people reached me out and asked if I could share it, so here we are.

## Usage
To start your project, [fork this respository](https://github.com/mmarfil/neocactus/fork), put in your content, and go!
